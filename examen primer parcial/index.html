    </div>
    <div class="text_bote">
        <p>The General Muir, established in January 2013 at Emory Point, is a modern American restaurant inspired by classic New York Jewish Deli,<br>
            returning it to its hand-crafted roots. Traditional favorites are honored — pastrami is cured and smoked in house, bagels are hand rolled <br>
            and kettle boiled — and joined by dishes going beyond tradition, focusing on fresh ingredients and simple preparations. A second <br>
            location in Sandy Springs opened in 2021.</p><br>
            The restaurant is named for the refugee transport ship that brought co-owner Jennifer Johnson's mother and grandparents, Holocaust<br>
            survivors, to New York in 1949. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e74ed686297ba58291c7268/t/5eda314739b3312678402e53/1591357767665/Origin+of+the+Name%2C+The+General+Muir.pdf" class="text_green_pdf"> Read more about the origin of our name</a>  and see the video by Atlanta Magazine below.<br>
            The General Muir serves breakfast, lunch, and weekend brunch at both locations, plus dinner at the Emory location, and offers an <br>
            espresso bar serving locally-roasted Dancing Goats coffee as well as a full bar of wine, beer, spirits, and cocktails. Next door to the <br>
            original Emory location, you’ll find TGM Bread and TGM Soup Co. pairing fresh baked breads and soups for a quick lunch, as well as<br>
            loaves to take home. TGM Bread bakes all of the bread daily for both locations, the rest of the Rye Restaurants family, and many other<br>
            restaurants around town.<br>

        <h2 class="Eat_Something">The Partners</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_bote">
        The General Muir is owned by Jennifer and Ben Johnson, Shelley Sweet, and Chef Todd Ginsberg, who also partner on Fred's Meat<br>
        & <a href="https://www.fredsmeatandbread.com/" class="text_green_pdf">Bread</a>  and <a href="https://www.yallaatl.com/" class="text_green_pdf">Yalla</a> in Krog Street Market and <a href="https://www.woodschapelbbq.com/" class="text_green_pdf">Wood's Chapel BBQ</a> in the historic Summerhill neighborhood of Atlanta — the <a href="https://www.ryerestaurants.com/" class="text_green_pdf">Rye Restaurants</a><br>
        family of restaurants.<br>

        The Johnsons, husband and wife, opened West Egg on Atlanta’s Westside in 2004. Both Jennifer (our "office girl") and Ben (fondly referred<br>
        to as "errand boy," although Renaissance man is more like it!) are former attorneys who practiced law in Atlanta for nearly 7 and 11 years,<br>
        respectively, before embarking on a second career in hospitality. West Egg proudly celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024.<br>

        Shelley Sweet found her passion for the restaurant industry after graduating college and working in graphic design, beginning her<br>
        restaurant career at West Egg when it opened in 2004. She joined the Concentrics Restaurant Group in 2006, serving as a manager at<br>
        Two Urban Licks, Assistant General Manager at Murphy’s, and ultimately as General Manager of TAP from 2008 to 2010. She was the<br>
        opening General Manager at Hugh Acheson’s Empire State South. Coming full circle, Shelley rejoined West Egg in 2011 as General<br>
        Manager, becoming a partner in 2014. Shelley, Jennifer, and Ben continue to partner on West Egg, with Chef Andrew Smith. Shelley is a<br>
        member of Les Dames d’Escoffier International, Atlanta Chapter, and recently served on the Georgia Restaurant Association Board of Directors.  <br>

        Todd Ginsberg is a 2014 and 2015 James Beard Foundation Semifinalist for Best Chef, Southeast and a graduate of the Culinary Institute<br>
        of America at Hyde Park, New York. He started his career at The Dining Room at The Ritz-Carlton in Atlanta under Joel Antunes and Bruno<br>
        Menard, led the kitchens at Asher in Roswell, Georgia, and Madison's in Highlands, North Carolina, and spent time at Lucas Carton in Paris<br>
        and at Alain Ducasse in New York. Upon his return to Atlanta, he worked for the Concentrics Restaurants group, serving as chef at both<br>
        TAP and Trois. Todd was the chef at Bocado from its opening in 2009 until partnering with Shelley, Jennifer, and Ben to open The General<br>
        Muir.<br>

        In 2014 the Georgia Restaurant Association honored Jennifer, Ben, Shelley and Todd as Restaurateurs of the Year and, in 2018, StarChefs <br>
        recognized them as Rising Star Restaurateurs.<br>

            The below images, taken from the deck of the Gen. Muir, were provided by Robert Boehm, whose father, Henry Boehm (Henryk Bohm) (center <br>
            of photo on left) arrived in this country aboard the Gen. Muir in March 1949, on the same voyage as Jennifer’s mother. We made this incredible <br>
            connection after the restaurant opened. Mr. Boehm, a Holocaust survivor, was a dentist, athlete, and Conservatory-trained operatic singer <br>
            from Lwow, Poland (now L’viv, Ukraine), just 40 miles from where Jennifer’s grandparents lived before the war. We appreciate the Boehm <br>
            family sharing these images; you can see them in person at our Sandy Springs location. <br>
